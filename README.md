# DLVO-Simulations-Cluster-Cluster-Interactions
Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) simulations of cluster–cluster interactions, including an accurate solver for the nanoparticle surface electrostatic potential.

1. DLVO simulation for RLCA cluster-cluster interactions modelling. Van der Waals and electrostatic potential models were designed based on the paper D.Sapalidis et al. .... on Upconversion nanoparticles clustering behavior. Containts retardation effects on the Hamaker coefficient of the van der Waals forces. Works when the aggregation process is mediated by long-range forces (e.g. at low ionic strength solutions) and not by short-range interactions of the closest pair of particles.
2. Zeta-to-surface potential converter for low ionic strength solutions. It solves the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation around a nanoparticle to provide a concentric spherical capacitor model from the surface to the Stern outer layer based on: Ma, X., Li, M. & Sun, C. Effect of ionic environment in aqueous solution on nucleation and stabilization of bulk nanobubbles. Appl. Surf. Sci. 656, 159726 (2024)
3. Extended DLVO simulations for spherical particle–particle interactions, including van der Waals, electrostatic, steric, and elastic contributions.
